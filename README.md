## Create a console app which allows me to create a singly linked list.
Restraints:
1. the number of nodes should be passed by the user in the console.
1. the value for each node should be given by the user separately after 1.
1. after adding values for all of the nodes the user should provide a number X
1. all of the nodes with values greater that X should be removed.
1. the final output should be the new list with the remaining elements.
